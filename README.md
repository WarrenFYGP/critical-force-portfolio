# Critical Force Portfolio

With the objective of obtaining a full stack web developer
position with Critical Force, I present two sample web sites,
each with an HTML5 front-end hosted as a GitHub "page",
connected to a back-end API written in Python and hosted
on an Ubuntu Linux server hosted in the DigitalOcean cloud.

Front-ends pages are written with HTML, CSS, and raw
JavaScript (no frameworks). Back-end APIs utilize the
Flask framework in Python and the SQLite database.

# [Critical Ops Knife Round]()

This site presents Critical Ops knife skins in a series of
head to head battles where users logged in via Discord may
vote on their preferred knife skin and comment on individual
skins.

# [Critical Competition]()

This site is loosely modeled after
[HLTV.org](https://hltv.org) to include news about recent
Critical Ops tournaments and player statistics. Users
logged in via Discord may comment on news articles.
